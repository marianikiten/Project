//create some classes of what potentially we can make of :

        this.ingredient2 = ingredient2
    }
    recipe(){return `you can cook  `}
}
//egg + oil = fried eggs
//egg + milk = omelet
//use API for recipes or create a form, that users will 
//fill out themselves, like input=eggs, input = milk
//OR use API https://www.themealdb.com/api.php with fetching
