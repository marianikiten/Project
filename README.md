# Project
My project is for those, who'd like to learn to cook. 
It is an app, that gives you a recipe, based on what ingredients you have. 
Just type in a couple of things you have in your fridge and get a simple recipe of what you can cook from them. Just press "Give me a recipe".
If you can't think of something specific,  just type in even 1 ingredient that you want to be the main in your dish, press "Give me a hint" and get a list of possible recipes, that you may have, if you add something else to you first ingredient.
On my page you'll find links to youtube videos with step-by-step description  of the recipes.
You can also comment and share your own dish descriptions there.
